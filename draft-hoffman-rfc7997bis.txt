                The Use of Non-ASCII Characters in RFCs
                      draft-hoffman-rfc7997bis-01

Abstract

   In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more
   diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for
   the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  While English remains the
   required language of the Series, the encoding of RFCs is now in UTF-
   8, allowing for a broader range of characters than typically used in
   the English language.  This document describes requirements and
   guidelines for the RFC Production Center regarding the use of non-
   ASCII characters in RFCs.

   This document updates RFC 7997 to reflect changes in the practices of
   the RFC series since RFC 7997 was published, and makes further
   changes based on agreements in the IETF community about what
   characters are allowed in RFCs.

1.  Introduction

   For much of the history of the RFC Series, the character encoding
   used for RFCs has been ASCII [RFC20].  This was a sensible choice at
   the time: the language of the Series has always been English, a
   language that primarily uses ASCII-encoded characters (ignoring for a
   moment words borrowed from more richly decorated alphabets); and,
   ASCII is the "lowest common denominator" for character encoding,
   making cross-platform viewing trivial.

   There are limits to ASCII, however, that hinder its continued use as
   the exclusive character encoding for the Series.  At the time of the
   publication of [RFC7997], the increasing need for easily readable,

Internet-Draft              Non-ASCII in RFCs                 March 2023


   internationalized content suggested that it is time to allow non-
   ASCII characters in RFCs where necessary.  To support this move away
   from ASCII, RFCs switched to supporting UTF-8 as the default
   character encoding and allowed support for a broad range of Unicode
   characters [UnicodeCurrent].

   Given the continuing goal of maximum readability across platforms,
   the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs should be limited to only
   where necessary within the text.  This document describes the rules
   under which non-ASCII characters may be used in an RFC.  These rules
   will be applied as the necessary changes are made to submission
   checking and editorial tools.

   This document updates the RFC Style Guide [RFC7322].

   The details included in this document are expected to change based on
   experience gained in publishing new RFCs.

1.1.  Acknowledgements

   RFC 7997 was written by Heather Flanagan, who was the RFC Series
   Editor (RSE) at the time of its publication.  Getting the IETF
   community to agree to the changes embodied in RFC 7997 was a
   difficult task, and it is likely that this current document would be
   much more difficult to write had RFC 7997 not been worked out first.

   The acknowledgements from RFC 7997 are to the members of the IAB i18n
   program, to the RFC Format Design Team: Nevil Brownlee, Tony Hansen,
   Joe Hildebrand, Paul Hoffman, Ted Lemon, Julian Reschke, Adam Roach,
   Alice Russo, Robert Sparks, and Dave Thaler.

1.2.  Changes from RFC 7997

   The following is an overview of the changes in this document from RFC
   7997:

   *  Added the role of the RFC stream approving bodies and the RFC
      Production Center (RPC) as described in [RFC9280] throughout the
      document.  In short, all responsibilities that were held by the
      RFC Editor in RFC 7997 are handled by the RPC.  If the RPC has
      questions about the content of RFCs, the RPC can ask the RFC
      stream approving bodies for input.

   *  Removed requirements of marking non-ASCII characters with XML
      markup.  Clarified that names with non-Latin characters should
      have Latin transliterations.

Internet-Draft              Non-ASCII in RFCs                 March 2023


   *  The basic requirements in Section 2 were softened to reflect the
      realities of the variability of search engines and web browsers.

   *  Changed Section 3 from "Rules for the Use of Non-ASCII Characters"
      to "Use of Non-ASCII Characters" because the RPC has used, and
      should continue to use, their own discretion based on what makes
      the RFC most useful.

   *  Language about the future was changed to the past tense to
      indicate that RFC 7997 was already implemented.  For example,
      "RFCs will switch" was changed to to "RFCs switched", and so on.

2.  Basic Requirements

   Two fundamental requirements inform the guidance and examples
   provided in this document.  They are:

   *  Searches against RFC indexes and database tables should return
      expected results and support appropriate Unicode string matching
      behaviors.

   *  RFCs should be displayed correctly across a wide range of readers
      and browsers.  People whose systems do not have the fonts needed
      to display a particular RFC need to be able to read the various
      publication formats and the XML correctly in order to understand
      and implement the information described in the document.

   The RPC may reject any code point that does not render adequately in
   commonly-used viewers.

3.  Use of Non-ASCII Characters

   This section describes the guidelines for the use of non-ASCII
   characters in an RFC.  If the RPC identifies areas where the use of
   non-ASCII characters in an RFC negatively impacts the readability of
   the text, they can require that the authors supply alternate text or
   change the non-ASCII characters to better suit the expected readers
   of the RFC.

   In general, using the "U+NNNN" syntax from [BCP137] is the suggested
   way to show Unicode code points as alternate text.

3.1.  General Usage throughout a Document

   As stated in the RFC Style Guide [RFC7322], the language of the RFC
   Series is English.





Hoffman                 Expires 2 September 2023                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              Non-ASCII in RFCs                 March 2023


   Where the use of non-ASCII characters is purely part of an example
   and not otherwise required for correct protocol operation, giving the
   Unicode equivalent of the non-ASCII characters is not required, but
   it can improve the readability of the RFC.  For example, for text
   that says "The value can be followed by a monetary symbol such as ¥
   or €", the RPC might require that it instead say "The value can be
   followed by a monetary symbol such as ¥ (U+00A5) or € (U+20AC)".

   Reference entries (bibliographic text) follow the rules given
   throughout this section.

   [ The example for this section from RFC 7997 has been removed.  It
   was, in fact, not an example of general usage but instead a protocol
   example. ]

3.2.  Person and Company Names

   [ RFC 7997 was inconsistent in its rules and examples of when names
   with non-ASCII characters should be spelled out using all-ASCII
   transliteration.  This section is significantly updated to clarify
   how names with non-ASCII characters should appear in RFCs. ]

   Person names may appear in several places within an RFC (e.g., the
   header, Acknowledgements, and References).

   When a script outside the ASCII character set is used for an
   individual name, an author-provided, ASCII-only transliteration can
   appear immediately after the non-ASCII characters, surrounded by
   parentheses.  The RPC decides on a case-by-case basis whether to
   include the ASCII-only transliteration.

   Names of authors appear at the top of RFCs and in the References
   section with a first initial (if available) and family name.  For
   example, Qin Wu's name might appear as "吴钦 (Q.  Wu)".  As another
   example, Patrik Fältström's name might appear as "P.  Fältström (P.
   Faltstrom)", but the version with non-ASCII Latin characters also
   might be left just as "P.  Fältström".

   In the Acknowledgements section, the person's full name is spelled
   out in full without the first initial, such as "The following people
   contributed to this document: 吴钦 (Qin Wu), ...".

   Company names follow the same rules as person names.

3.3.  Body of the Document

   When the mention of non-ASCII characters is required for correct
   protocol operation and understanding, the characters' Unicode code
   points must be used in the text.  This is equally true in running
   text and tables.  The addition of each character name is encouraged.

   *  Non-ASCII characters require identifying the Unicode code point,
      at least on first use in the RFC.

   *  Use of the actual UTF-8 character (such as common math symbols
      like &#8730;) is encouraged so that a reader can more easily see
      what the character is.

   *  As stated in Section 3, using the "U+NNNN" syntax from [BCP137] is
      the suggested way to show Unicode code points as alternate text.

   [ Removed "The use of the Unicode character names like "INCREMENT" in
   addition to the use of Unicode code points is also encouraged."  This
   text was, in fact, wrong in 7997 because the character name did not
   match the example. ]

   For example, [RFC7564] says:

   However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full
   range of Unicode code points into protocol strings.  For example,
   the characters U+13DA U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2 from
   the Cherokee block look similar to the ASCII characters
   "STPETER" as they might appear when presented using a "creative"
   font family.

   This could be replaced with:

   However, the problem is made more serious by introducing the full
   range of Unicode code points into protocol strings.  For example,
   the characters "ᏚᎢᎵᎬᎢᎬᏒ" (U+13DA
   U+13A2 U+13B5 U+13AC U+13A2 U+13AC U+13D2) from the Cherokee block
   look similar to the ASCII characters "STPETER" as they might
   appear when presented using a "creative" font family.

   [BCP137] describes the pros and cons of different options for
   identifying Unicode characters and may help authors decide how to
   represent the non-ASCII characters in their documents.

   Code components may have different requirements for using the U+
   notation.  The use of the U+ notation in code components is
   recommended, except within a code component where one must follow the
   rules of the programming language in which the code is being written.

3.4.  Keywords and Citation Tags

   Keywords (as tagged with the <keyword> element in XML) and citation
   tags (as defined in the anchor attributes of <reference> elements)
   must contain only ASCII characters.

   [ Does the WG still want this restriction? ]

3.5.  Authors' Address Information

   The purpose of providing authors' address information, either postal
   or email, is to assist readers of an RFC in contacting the author or
   authors.  Authors may include the official postal address as
   recognized by their company or local postal service without
   additional Unicode character identification.

   If an author's email address includes non-ASCII characters and is a
   valid email address at the time of publication, it may be given
   without additional Unicode character identification.

4.  Normalization Forms

   Authors should not expect normalization forms [UnicodeNorm] to be
   preserved.  If a particular normalization form is expected, it must
   be noted in the text of the RFC.

5.  XML Markup

   [ This section needs revision after community discussion ]

   As described above, use of non-ASCII characters in areas such as
   email, company name, address, and name is allowed.  In order to make
   it easier for code to identify the appropriate ASCII alternatives,
   authors must include an "ascii" attribute to their XML markup when an
   ASCII alternative is required.  See [RFC7991] for more detail on how
   to tag ASCII alternatives.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   The ability to use non-ASCII characters in RFCs in a clear and
   consistent manner improves the ability to describe internationalized
   protocols and recognizes the diversity of authors.  However, the goal
   of readability overrides the use of non-ASCII characters within the
   text.

7.  Security Considerations

   Valid Unicode that matches the expected text must be verified in
   order to preserve expected behavior and protocol information.
